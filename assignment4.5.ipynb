        "### Analysis of Informal Language Handling in Social Media Posts\n",
        "\n",
        "For social media posts, informal language, sentiment, and implicit meanings are crucial for accurate classification. Our simulated LLM, being keyword-based, faced significant challenges in these areas across all prompting techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot Prompting:**\n",
        "    *   **Post 1 (Promotion):** \"Check out our massive summer sale! 50% off all items for a [...]\" - Correctly classified as `Promotion`. The keywords like \"sale,\" \"50% off,\" and \"discount\" were direct and easily matched.\n",
        "    *   **Post 2 (Complaint):** \"Absolutely frustrated with your customer service! Waited 30 mins [...]\" - Misclassified as `Inquiry`. Despite strong negative sentiment and phrases like \"frustrated,\" the simulation's keyword list for `Complaint` (\"bad service,\" \"unhappy,\" \"issue,\" \"problem,\" \"not working\") was not broad enough to capture this specific expression of complaint. Instead, it defaulted to `Inquiry` because words like \"service\" might have vaguely triggered its default.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **One-shot Prompting:**\n",
        "    *   **Example (Appreciation):** \"Just received my order and I absolutely LOVE it! Great quality [...]\" - This example was for `Appreciation`.\n",
        "    *   **Post to Classify (Complaint):** \"My package was supposed to arrive yesterday but it's still not here. What's going on?!\" - Misclassified as `Inquiry`.\n",
        "    *   The single `Appreciation` example provided no keywords or context relevant to a complaint. The target post's informal language (\"What's going on?!\") and implied frustration were not recognized as `Complaint` due to the lack of explicit keywords in our simulation. Thus, it again defaulted to `Inquiry`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Few-shot Prompting:**\n",
        "    *   **Examples (Promotion, Complaint, Appreciation, Inquiry):** A diverse set of examples was provided, including one for `Complaint`.\n",
        "    *   **Post to Classify (Complaint):** \"My package was supposed to arrive yesterday but it's still not here. What's going on?!\" - Misclassified as `Inquiry`.\n",
        "    *   Even with a dedicated `Complaint` example and others, the target post still fell into `Inquiry`. The `Complaint` example provided used phrases like \"frustrated with your customer service!\" which contained keywords like \"service\" and \"frustrated.\" The target post, \"My package was supposed to arrive yesterday but it's still not here. What's going on?!\" contains neither specific complaint keywords ('bad service', 'unhappy', 'issue', 'problem', 'not working') nor inquiry keywords like 'how to', 'where is', 'question', 'can i', 'what about', but defaulted to 'Inquiry' due to the final `else` clause in the simulated LLM. This highlights that our simulated keyword rules are rigid and don't benefit from the contextual learning that a real LLM would derive from few-shot examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion on Informal Language Handling (Simulated vs. Real LLM):**\n",
        "\n",
        "Our current simulated LLM, due to its reliance on direct keyword matching, struggles significantly with informal language, slang, implied sentiment, and nuanced expressions common in social media posts. The examples provided in one-shot and few-shot prompting *only influence the prompt string*, but do not alter the underlying keyword-matching logic. Therefore, for our simulation, there was **no observable improvement in handling informal language** or overall technical accuracy when moving from zero-shot to one-shot or few-shot for social media posts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, a **real LLM** would be expected to show substantial improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Zero-shot:** Would leverage its vast pre-training to understand the intent behind informal language.\n",
        "*   **One-shot/Few-shot:** Would learn from the provided examples to better recognize patterns, sentiment, and the context of informal phrases, leading to more accurate classifications for posts like the complaint about a delayed package."
